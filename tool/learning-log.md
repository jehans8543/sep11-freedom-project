* First day reseraching the tool _three.js_
  * Tried learning on **what is three.js?**
  * Went on the site [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/introduction-to-three-js/)
* What I learned from [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/introduction-to-three-js/):
  * three.js is an **open-source** JavaScript library which is used to display graphics, being able to disply 3D and 2D visuals on a web browswer.
* Lets you use GPU to render graphics and 3D objects on a canvas in the web browswer.
* Since you are using javascript you can edit with other HTML elements.
* Three.js supports most browswers.
* Does not require third party plug in order to run the code. 
  * Follow Up Questions from the Article I read:
    * What does it mean when something is **open-source**
      * I asked ChatGPT and it told me:
        * souce code that is avaiable to the public for anyone to use under a specific license.
        * anyone can modify, use, view, and redistribute the code anytime that they want
  * How to Use:
    * download the complete three.js on system files and upload it from there
