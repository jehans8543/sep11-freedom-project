## Choosing a Topic
After finishing the SEP 10 course, we now advanced onto the SEP 11 course. Meaning that we had to create a brand new _Freedom Project_, correlating to the topics that we learn in this course which is **javascript**.

Last year in the SEP 10 showcase, my freedom project ended up getting _honorable mention_. I was very proud of myself, though if I could do it again I would make some changes based on the feedback that I got from some of the judges. The main peace of feedback that I got that stopped me from succeeding was my **lack of creativity** in my project.

The reason why I believed that my project lacked creativity last year was due to the fact that I choose a topic that didn't provide much room for that. Therefore for this year's freedom project I decided to make it a point to choose a topic that would give me space to be open with my creativness.

I was stuck between two project ideas in general, one of them was creating a _cell model_ while another one of my ideas were an _organization tool_. I found myself between these two ideas until Mr. Mueller provided us with a tool list.

### Choosing a Tool
Unlike last year, we were given the tool list and had to choose a tool immediately. Since it would take a longer time to learn and reserach our new tool.

Since I had two differnt ideas that I was consdidering, I decided to reserach two differnt tools which are: [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [gDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/)

First I researched the two tools and what they each do

#### Three.js
* JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL
* Simplifies 3D rendering with built-in abstractions for lights, cameras, and objects
* Supports real-time 3D animations and interactive graphics

#### gDevelop
* No-code game engine designed for quick, intuitive game creation
* Uses event-based logic to define game behaviors instead of traditional coding
* Built-in library of assets and templates to speed up development
