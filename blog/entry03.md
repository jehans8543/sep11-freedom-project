## A Quick Progress Check
It's been two months since my last blog, and I didn't start anything related to my project just yet. Instead I was taking my time to learn more about my tool. Three.js is a considerbly difficult tool, since it requires a 3D shapes with a certain type of code that I have not yet learned. Learning the new code was extremely diffcult, especially since I struggle with Javascript enough as it is. Though I felt as if I made a lot of progress with my learning, since I took the time to understand little pieces of code which work together to make a bigger piece of code with a more remarkable results. 

### Tinkering with my Tool 
#### Mini Project
The best way for me to evaluate and connect all my learning is to create a mini-coding project for myself using the things I learned about three.js since the start of the school year.

I created a scene with a camera and a cube, I set up the render position and was able to learn how to move the camera fully. I also tried rendering the cube so that it can rotate.
