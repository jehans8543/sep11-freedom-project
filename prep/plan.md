#### MVP

* **Deadline** - 03/02/2026
- [ ] Create a scene
  - [ ] Uses DOM (concept 1)
    - [ ] `document.body.appendChild()` 
- [ ] Make a base model for the animal cell 
  - [ ] make it into a spherical shape
  - [ ] base color of the base
    - [ ] hex code: #5d9aa8
  - [ ] set up camera + rotation of the basic model
    - [ ] uses function (concept 2)

* **Deadline** - 03/16/2026
- [ ] Make the cell membrane
  - [ ] another spherical shape within the bigger one
    - [ ] make only the radius of it show
  - [ ] hex code: #3e6b75
- [ ] Create two more organelles (all uses spherical shapes) 
  - [ ] Nucleus (hex code: #3e5175)
    - [ ] if possible create the nucleolus and nuclear membrane 
  - [ ] vaculoes (hex code: #96b1e3)
     
* **Deadline** - 04/06/2026
- [ ] Finish rest of the MAIN organelles
  - [ ] mitochondrian
  - [ ] smooth endoplasmic reticulum
  - [ ] rough endoplasmic reticulum
  - [ ] lysosome
  - [ ] cytoplasm 

#### Beyond MVP
- [ ] Clickable organelles 
  - [ ] explains the function of those organelle
- [ ] Looping animations demonstrating the process of the organelles within the cell
- [ ] Plant cell model
  - [ ] linking page to the animal cell model (easy to go back and forth)
  - [ ] clickable organelles
    - [ ] explains the functions of those organelles
- [ ] Adding detail to the organelles that were already created
  - [ ] more shapes within the shapes
- [ ] organize the organelles within an array (concept 3)
- [ ] make a background, so the cell model can pop out more and be more visual appealing

## Timeline

### MVP

- [ ] Front-end
  - [x] Webpage to collect input from user (deadline: 4/15)
  - [ ] Webpage to display "yes, but a ___ can't" or "no, but a ___ can" (deadline: 5/1)
- [x] Back-end
  - [x] Use regex to test whether or not the word can go through the GGD (deadline: 3/1)
  - [x] Use the Twinword API to find related words (deadline: 3/15)
    - [ ] Iterate through the words until an opposite example can be found (deadline: 4/1)

#### Beyond MVP

- [ ] Use another API to make sure the opposite example is a noun
- [ ] Automate notification of API limit to make sure I don’t exceed free quota
- [ ] A multiple choice quizzer that will test the user’s knowledge of the solution
